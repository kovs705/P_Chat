## How does it work
The Multipeer Connectivity framework enables communication between devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. It provides a high-level API that abstracts the underlying network protocols and handles the complexities of establishing and maintaining connections.

### Some of the key components of the Multipeer Connectivity framework include:
 - **MCSession**: An object that represents a session between connected peers.
 - **MCPeerID**: Identifies each user uniquely in a session.
 - **MCAdvertiserAssistant**: An object that advertises the availability of your app to nearby devices.
 - **MCNearbyServiceBrowser**: An object that helps discover nearby devices that are advertising their availability.
